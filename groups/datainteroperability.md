# Data interoperability in Learning Analytics ecosystems

### Members

A document is being prepared as a part of this challenge that acts as a position statement. It points to the problems emerging for those who would use either xAPI or Caliper in LA applications. Specifically, it seeks to:

- Promote best practice that can be followed by those building Learning Record Providers (LRPs) in xAPI and Event Emitters in Caliper to ensure that data interoperability is achievable in a minimal sense i.e. without achieving a full mapping between the specifications, which we consider in practice impossible.  
- Ensure that the data produced by vendors is actually useful to those building LA solutions.
- Provide guidelines to those who would tender for EdTech products to ensure that they receive services that they can use.
